## Using These Layouts
This layout pack includes many layouts with many different aspect ratios, including 4:3 and 16:9 (from 1p to 4p), GB, GBA, DS, 3DS, intermission, and a customizable omnibar. Photoshop files are also included for easy editing, from simply changing the colors to rearranging elements in your layout. And detailed documentation ensures you know what you're doing.
