## About
*This is a bundle for [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg); if you do not understand what that is, we advise you read their website first for more information.*

speedcontrol-layouts was the layout pack used during Horror(ible) Games 2021 - Heartbreak, tweaked to make creating layouts easier.

### Features
- 14 easy-to-use and customizable layouts with deteiled documentation
- Full Tiltify and Oengus support, showing total amount raised and incentives/prizes
- A sponsor area, for showcasing products and other events
- Various Photoshop files to easily make your own layouts

## Requirements
- [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg)
- [NodeCG Speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) (please use the build branch)

Additionally, although not required, some basic knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS will make it easier to customize these layouts to your liking.

## Installation
Navigate to your root NodeCG folder, then run `nodecg install nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts`. After the installation is complete, type `nodecg defaultconfig speedcontrol-layouts` to generate the config file.

Now you're ready to customize! For guidance, the [wiki](https://github.com/nicnacnic/speedcontrol-layouts/wiki) has everything covered!

## Usage
Use this layout pack as you normally would use a NodeCG graphic. Included are many layouts with many configurations, including 4:3 and 16:9 (from 1p to 4p), GB, GBA, DS, 3DS, intermission, interview, and a customizable omnibar. Photoshop files are also included for easy editing, from simply changing the colors to rearranging elements in your layout. They can be found in `<path_to_nodecg>/bundles/speedcontrol-layouts/graphics/img/photoshop`.

If you end up using speedcontrol-layouts during your marathon/event, it would be greatly appreciated if you included the repository name and author in your end credits. Thank you!
